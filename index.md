### Hello there!

My name is Maksim. I'm software engineer. My specialization is designing and developing high-load ready backend web services. I have bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and some years of experience in production software development.

### My open source projects:

[**aiohttp-apispec**](https://github.com/maximdanilchenko/aiohttp-apispec) - extension to [**aiohttp**](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) that helps in building and documenting REST APIs.

[**radish**](https://github.com/maximdanilchenko/radish) - redis-like DB and its async client implementation written in python36/asyncio without any dependencies.

[**mgun**](https://github.com/maximdanilchenko/mgun) - HTTP REST Client based on [**requests**](https://github.com/requests/requests) with dynamic url building (and its async analog - [**async-mgun**](https://github.com/maximdanilchenko/async-mgun)).

Some other projects mostly for fun (like [**lazy**](https://github.com/maximdanilchenko/lazy)) or experience you can find on [my github](https://github.com/maximdanilchenko)

### I am good at:


```Python``` - strong knowledge of the language, extensive knowledge of tools and methods to solve typical and non-typical problems, mostly in web development. Also I have experience in ```C++```, ```JS```, ```Erlang```

Databases - relational DBs (```PostgreSQL```, ```MySQL```), column DBs (```Cassandra```/```Scylla```), ```MongoDB```, Cashing (```Redis```/```MemCashed```)

Queues/PubSub - ```RabbitMQ```/```Redis```

Unit/Integration/Load Testing

```HTTP```/```sockets``` protocols, ```JSON```/```Protobuf```/```TLV```(binary)/```XML```/```CSV ```data formats

```HTML```/```JS```/```CSS``` - enough for understanding and building simple web sites

ML/Big Data - ```recommendation systems```, ```text mining```, ```classification```

CI/CD (```Jenkins```/```TravisCI```/```TeamCity```) - building, testing and deploying automation, version control tools (```Git```/```SVN```)

Project management - ```Jira```/```Trello```, ```Confluence```, ```Microsoft Project```
